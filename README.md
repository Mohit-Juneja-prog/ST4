1. I am Mohit Juneja (Roll no. 2010991631) of Group 20.
2. I have made a Blogging app where you can write and edit blogs freely.
3. On Home page, there are some default blogs which can be deleted if required. You can search blogs in search bar.
4. On Post page, you can write a blog with a title and upload it, which will be visible in Home page.
5. An About page is added to tell a little about the app. 
6. React Router was used for navigation between the pages.
